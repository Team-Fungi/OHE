# One Hot Encoding - Convolutional Neural Network
This directory includes the results of running the CNN on OHE on the following taxonomic levels: PHYLUM, CLASS, ORDER, FAMILY and GENUS. There are 4 files, corresponding to the result of training, validating and testing with the 4 datasets created in the Data Preparation phase (5% cut-off with ambiguous nucleotides, 5% cut-off without ambiguous nucleotides, 1% cut-off with ambiguous nucleotides, 1% cut-off without ambiguous nucleotides).\
To optimize both running time and the F1 score, the models were trained for different numbers of epochs for each taxonomic level. The model was trained for 120 epochs on phylum level, 140 epochs on class level, 160 epochs on order level, 180 epochs on family level and 200 epochs on genus level. These specific epoch numbers were chosen as they represented a sweet spot between achieving satisfactory F1 scores while keeping the training time manageable.
